For example, on a new system without python or git installed, they can be installed from a powershell terminal
open as administrator: ::

    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072 -bor 768 -bor 192 -bor 48

    iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scikit-build/scikit-ci-addons/master/windows/install-python-36-x64.ps1'))
    iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scikit-build/scikit-ci-addons/master/windows/install-git.ps1'))

      to install python for specific architecture. By default, both are installed.
      Values "86" and "32" correspond to the same architecture.
    - setting ``$pythonPrependPath`` to 1 will add install and Scripts directories the PATH and .PY to PATHEXT. This
      variable should be set only if ``$pythonVersion`` and ``$pythonArch`` are set. By default, the value is 0.

    Systematically download `$url` into `$file`.


  ``Download-File($url, $file)``:

    If file is not found, download `$url` into `$file`.


  ``Download-URL($url, $downloadDir)``:

    Download `$url` into `$downloadDir`. The filename is extracted from `$url`.


  ``Install-MSI($fileName, $downloadDir, $targetDir)``:

    Programatically install MSI installers `$downloadDir\$fileName`
    into `$targetDir`. The package is installed for all users.


  ``Which($progName)``

    Search for `$progName` in the ``PATH`` and return its full path.


  ``Download-7zip($downloadDir)``:

    If not found, download 7zip executable ``7za.exe`` into `$downloadDir`. The function
    returns the full path to the executable.


  ``Always-Extract-Zip($filePath, $destDir)``:

    Systematically extract zip file `$filePath` into `$destDir` using
    7zip. If 7zip executable ``7za.exe`` is not found in `$downloadDir`, it is downloaded

As explained the `chololatey documentation <https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/Installation#installing-with-restricted-tls>`_,
this most likely happens because the build script is attempting to download from a server that needs to use TLS 1.1 or
TLS 1.2 and has restricted the use of TLS 1.0 and SSL v3.

The first things to try is to use the following snippet replacing ``https://file/to/download`` with
the appropriate value::

    $securityProtocolSettingsOriginal = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol

    try {
        # Set TLS 1.2 (3072), then TLS 1.1 (768), then TLS 1.0 (192), finally SSL 3.0 (48)
        # Use integers because the enumeration values for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.1 won't
        # exist in .NET 4.0, even though they are addressable if .NET 4.5+ is
        # installed (.NET 4.5 is an in-place upgrade).
        [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072 -bor 768 -bor 192 -bor 48
    } catch {
        Write-Warning 'Unable to set PowerShell to use TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.1 due to old .NET Framework installed. If you see underlying connection closed or trust errors, you may need to upgrade to .NET Framework 4.5 and PowerShell v3'
    }

    iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://file/to/download'))

    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = $securityProtocolSettingsOriginal


If that does not address the problem, you should update the version of `.NET` installed and install
a newer version of PowerShell:
